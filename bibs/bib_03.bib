abstract = "The kinetics of the oxidation of toluene have been studied in close interaction with the gasâ€“liquid mass transfer occurring in the reactor. Kinetic parameters for a simple model have been estimated on basis of experimental observations performed under industrial conditions. The conclusions for the mass transfer and reaction regime on basis of experimental observations and model calculations are in good agreement: toluene oxidation under industrial conditions can be characterized as a slow reaction with respect to mass transfer."
